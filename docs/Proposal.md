# Project Proposal
## Car Store

### 1. Project Relevance

Buying a car is a complex decision that usually requires comparing many options based on price, specifications, condition, and availability. In many existing platforms, car information is unstructured, incomplete, or scattered across different sources such as classified ads and social media. This makes the selection process inconvenient for users and inefficient for sellers.

The **Car Store System** aims to solve this problem by providing a centralized and structured web application for browsing cars and managing purchase requests. Each car is presented as a standardized product with clearly defined attributes, allowing users to easily compare options and make informed decisions. From the seller’s perspective, the system simplifies catalog management and customer request processing.

This project is relevant because it reflects a real-world business scenario and demonstrates how a web-based information system can improve both user experience and operational efficiency.

### 2. Competitor Analysis

Several existing solutions partially cover the functionality of a car store system:

**General classified advertisement platforms**  
These platforms offer a large number of listings but often suffer from inconsistent data formats, lack of verification, and weak filtering capabilities. Users must manually compare listings, and sellers have limited control over request management.

**Social media and messenger groups**  
Cars are frequently sold through platforms like Instagram or Telegram groups. While posting is fast and informal, searching, filtering, and tracking offers is difficult. Important information is often lost in message history, and there is no structured request workflow.

**Official dealer websites**  
Dealer websites usually provide reliable information, but they are often limited to a single seller, lack advanced filtering, and do not provide a unified request tracking system for users.

**Competitive Advantage of Car Store**  
The proposed system is competitive due to:
- Structured and standardized car data
- Advanced search and filtering
- Clear separation of user and admin roles
- Centralized request (order) management
- Simple and transparent workflow for both buyers and administrators

### 3. Target Users

The Car Store System is designed for the following user groups:

**Guests**  
Unregistered visitors who can browse the car catalog, search and filter cars, and view detailed information about each vehicle.

**Registered Users**  
Users who create an account to interact more actively with the system. They can create purchase requests (orders), manage favorites, view their order history, and edit their profile information.

**Administrators**  
System managers responsible for maintaining the platform. They manage car listings, upload images, and process user orders by updating their statuses.

Each user group has clearly defined responsibilities and permissions, ensuring a secure and organized system.

### 6. Conclusion

The Car Store System is a practical and realistic web application project that demonstrates key concepts of backend development, system design, and team collaboration. By focusing on clear architecture, structured data, and well-defined user roles, the project provides a solid foundation for further development while fully satisfying the requirements of the current assignment.
